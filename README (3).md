# Learning Github

Welcome to my Github repository where I will be reinforcing my knowledge of Github and earning achievement badges along the way.

This repository serves as a platform for me to practice using various Github features and tools, such as version control, branching, merging, and pull requests. By doing so, I hope to become more proficient in using Github for future projects and collaborations.

Additionally, I plan to automate daily commits to this repository to ensure consistent activity and progress tracking.

Feel free to explore the contents of this repository and follow along with my journey of learning and improving my Github skills.
